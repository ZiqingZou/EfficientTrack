# üì¶ EfficientTrack

This is the official implement od our paper: "High-precision and high-efficiency trajectory tracking for excavators based on closed-loop dynamics."

EfficientTrack is a learning-enhanced trajectory tracking framework designed to tackle the complex nonlinear dynamics of hydraulic excavators, including time delays and control coupling. Traditional control methods often struggle with these challenges, while standard learning-based approaches require extensive environment interaction.

EfficientTrack combines model-based learning with closed-loop dynamics to significantly improve learning efficiency and minimize tracking errors. It achieves superior precision and smoothness with fewer interactions.
